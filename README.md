this is a android studio project to make my school schedule very accessible on wear os watches. it uses notofications and internet conection to get the current time and the current hour of my school to retrive it and print it on the app/notification.

if you want to use it your first need to clone the project then you need to set your class in the app and then adb connect to your wear os watch and run it on the watch.

the C10_7 is the class you need to change
